Abstract — The objective of face recognition involves the
extraction of different features of the human face from the face
image for discriminating it from other persons. It is the
problem of searching a face in reference database to find the
matches as a given face. The purpose is to find a face that has
highest similarity with a given face in the database. Many face
recognition algorithms have been developed and used as an
application of access control and surveillance. For enhancing
the performance and accuracy of biometric face recognition
system, we use a multi-algorithmic approach, where in a
combination of four different individual face recognition
techniques is used. In this paper, we develop a face recognition
systems based on one combination of four individual
techniques namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Template Matching using
Correlation (Corr) and Partitioned Iterative Function System
(PIFS). We fuse the scores of all of these four techniques in a
single face recognition system. We perform a comparative
study of face recognition rate of this face recognition system at
two precision levels namely at Top-5 and at Top-10 IDs. We
experiment it with a standard ORL face database.
Experimentally, we find that recognition rate by PCA-DCT
technique is better than by individual PCA and DCT
techniques and recognition rate by PCA-DCT-Corr technique
is better than the PCA-DCT technique. Overall, we find the
system based on combination of all of the four individual
techniques outperforms.
are those based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
Template Matching using Correlation, Neural Network,
Model Matching, Partitioned Iterated Function System
(PIFS), Wavelet and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
For enhancing the accuracy and to increase the
performance of the face recognition system a combination
of these algorithms in a group of two or three individual
techniques can be used. In this paper, we discuss the four
different individual face recognition techniques based on
PCA, DCT, Template Matching using Correlation, PIFS
and also discuss recently developed different multi-
algorithmic approaches for the face recognition systems
based on the different combinations (in group of two or
three) of these individual techniques [1], and we use the
same multi-algorithmic approach for the face recognition
systems based on the different combinations but in group
of four of these individual techniques. The goal is to find
which combination of these techniques performs better in
terms of face recognition rate.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we
discuss in brief the previous studies performed in the area of
face recognition systems and in the corresponding
subsection, we give an overview of the face database (ORL)
used. In section 3, we discuss in brief the face recognition
systems. In section 4, we show the multi-algorithmic
approach for the face recognition systems based on the
different in group of two and three combinations of
individual techniques discussed in section 3. In section 5,
we discuss the multi-algorithmic approach for the face
recognition systems based on the different combinations in
group of four individual techniques. In section 6, we analyse
the results at top 5/10 IDs. Finally, we conclude and give
some future directions.

I NTRODUCTION
Unique facial characteristics of human beings often
recognize one another. In the face recognition approach, a
given face is compared with the faces stored in a face
database in order to identify the person. The purpose is to
find a face in the database, which has the highest similarity
with the given face. Most successful forms of the human
surveillance are the Facial recognition. In the fields of
biometric, facial recognition technology is one of the fastest
growing fields. Several studies have been reported in the
last 10 to 15 years given in [2], [3] and [4].
With working together, efforts from the researchers in
different fields including computer engineering,
mathematics, psychophysics and neuroscience, different
outlooks have evolved to solve the problem of face
recognition [5]. Among these, the projecting approaches

On the analysis of face recognition system some of the
important studies on face recognition systems are discussed,
PCA also known as Eigen face method, In PCA method the
images are projected onto the facial value so called
eigenspace [7] and [13]. PCA approach reduces the
dimension of the data by means of basic data compression
method [3] and reveals the most effective low dimensional
structure of facial patterns [4]. LFA method of recognition
is based on the analysis the face in terms of local features
e.g. eye, nose etc. by what is referred LFA kernels.
Recognition by Neural Network [10] and 14] are based on
228
222Another approach is the Template matching using
correlation; it is the process of locating the position of a sub
image inside a larger image. The sub image is called the
template and the larger image is called the search area. The
template matching process involves shifting the template
over the search area and computing the similarity measure
between the template and the window in the search area over
which the template lies. The correlation between two signals
(cross correlation) is a standard approach to feature detection
[13] as well as a building block for more sophisticated
recognition techniques. All images of natural or human made
objects show region wise self similarity although they may
not be globally self similar. Such images can be represented
by Partitioned Iterative function System (PIFS) [19].
learning of the faces in an ‘Example Set’ by the machine in
the ‘Training Phase’ and carrying out recognition in the
‘Generalization Phase’. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
technique is in fact one of the binary classification methods.
The support vectors consist of a small subset of training data
extracted by the algorithm given in [11]. Face recognition
based on template matching represents a face in terms of a
template consisting of several enclosing masks the
projecting features e.g. the mouth, the eyes and the nose
[12]. In [15] a face detection method based on half face-
template is discussed. Recognition technique formulated on
Partitioned Iterated Function System (PIFS) [8] makes use
of the fact that human face shows self-similarity region-
wise, which is utilized for encoding the face to generate the
PIFS code, by matching the PIFS codes recognition is
performed. In [18] the face recognition system based on
partitioned Iterated Function System is discussed, in which
face recognition based on PIFS representation and matching
is carried out in the domain of PIFS code. In [16] Bayesian
approach to face recognition based on wavelet transform is
discussed. In [17] illumination normalization is proposed by
exploiting the correlation of discrete cosine transform
(DCT) low-frequency coefficients to illumination variations.

A. Combinig two or three individual algorithms
Different algorithms are employed to recognize a query
face of the biometric face recognition systems, as pointed out
in [9], fusing the scores of several techniques applied on the
same data is a good approach to improve the overall
accuracy of a biometric system [16]. For combining two
individual techniques, we fused the scores of two individual
techniques in order to increase the performance of the
system. The first multi-algorithmic technique in combination
of PCA and DCT individual techniques named PCA-DCT
face recognition system [1]. In this system, first we extract
the PCA feature vector and then extract DCT feature vector
of the reference face database images. For combining three
techniques, we fuse the scores of three individual techniques
in order to increase the performance of the system. For
implementing this type of multi-algorithmic approach, first
we extract the PCA feature vector, DCT feature vector and
Templates with Correlation of the reference face database
images as discussed earlier. Reference face image database
when subjected to PCA the PCA reference feature vector
database is obtained and same for other individual
algorithms. The second multi-algorithmic technique is the
combinations of three individual algorithms named PCA-
DCT-Corr face recognition system. In this system, first we
extract the PCA feature vector, extract Corr feature vector
and extract DCT feature vector of the reference face database
images. To recognize a particular input query face, the
system compares the face’s feature vector to the feature
vector of the database faces using Euclidean Distance nearest
neighbor classifier [6].
ORL Face Database
The ORL face database was originally published by
Cambridge University. ORL database contains a set of faces
taken between April 1992 and April 1994 at the Olivetti
Research Laboratory in Cambridge, U.K. [20]. It consists of
400 face images taken from 40 people, 10 images per person.
For each person, it contains face images under different
lighting conditions, facial expressions, and poses. All the
images are against a dark homogeneous background with the
subjects in an up-right, frontal position, with tolerance for
some tilting and rotation of up to about 20 degrees. There are
variations in images of different persons like persons have
beard, persons have glasses, persons have moustaches etc.
The images are grayscale with a resolution of 92 X 112
pixels in bitmap file format.

Face Recognition System (FRS) is the computer
application of recognizing similar faces from the images of
face database. Four individual techniques of face recognition
systems are: PCA, DCT, Template matching using
Correlation and PIFS. To implementing each technique, we
follow three steps that are: (1) Face preprocessing steps, (2)
Feature vector extraction and (3) Recognition step. In
preprocessing step, resizing of the images are performed
because original images have more values by which
eigenface computation becomes complex. In the feature
vector extraction step: in case of PCA, find the eigenvectors
with the highest eigenvalue. The Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) converts an image from spatial domain to frequency
domain [17], its DCT is computed and only a subset of the
obtained coefficients is retained. In this work, 2D DCT has
been used to extract feature vectors from face image.
B. Combining four individual algorithms
Fusing the scores of several techniques applied on the
same data (face image) is a good approach to improve the
overall accuracy of a biometric system as says in [16].
Therefore, in this paper, we fuse all the four individual
algorithms based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Template Matching using
Correlation (Corr) and Partitioned Iterated Function System
(PIFS) into single face recognition system. The schematic
diagram of this system is shown in Figure 6. In this system,
first we extract the PCA feature vector, extract PIFS feature
223
229vector, extract DCT feature vector and extract Template with
correlation feature vector of the reference face database
images. To implement this type of multi-algorithmic
approach, first we extract the PCA feature vector, DCT
feature vector, Templates and the PIFS code of the reference
face database images as discussed in above paragraph.
Reference face image database when subjected to PCA, PCA
reference feature vector database is obtained. In Template
Matching the templates of eyes, nose and mouth are created
and stored as reference Template database.

R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION
In this work on multi-algorithmic face recognition, we
implemented a face recognition system by combining four
individual techniques. We also compare the performance of
this face recognition system with the performance of the
combination of two and three individual techniques PCA-
DCT and PCA-DCT-Corr. The experimental results are
obtained on Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) face image
database [21]. This ORL face database acts as the reference
face database and contains 400 face images. There are 10
face images each of 40 different persons. These systems are
evaluated on the basis of recognition rate obtained at two
levels, namely (i) at top 5-IDs and (ii) at top 10-IDs. Each
image in the reference face image database is made as query.
Results of top ten close matches of face ID= 234 and pose
no. 24 of the three face recognition systems based on multi-
algorithmic approaches: PCA-DCT, PCA-DCT-Corr and
PCA-DCT-Corr-PIFS are shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, and
Figure 3 respectively. In each of these figures the first image
is the query image. Here, we have shown few results due to
space limitation.
Figure 2: PCA-DCT-Corr System: Top ten close matches: the first
image is the query image
Figure 3: PCA-DCT-Corr-PIFS System: Top ten close matches:

We have analyzed the results at two levels, at Top 5 IDs
and at Top 10 IDs. Table 1 show the average face
recognition rate at Top 5 IDs. We find that the PCA-DCT-
Corr-PIFS based face recognition systems has highest
recognition rate as compared to other four systems shown at
this level, and graphically shown in Figure 4. Table 2 show
the average face recognition rate at Top 10 IDs. We find
that the PCA-DCT-Corr-PIFS based face recognition
systems has highest recognition rate as compared to other
four systems shown at this level, and graphically shown in
Figure 5.

In this work, we reported the development of the multi-
algorithmic face recognition systems based on four
individual techniques namely PCA, DCT, Correlation and
PIFS with the combination of all four individual algorithms.
In the multi-algorithmic approach, we combine these four
individual techniques in a pair of two, three and all to obtain
combinations face recognition system namely PCA-DCT,
PCA-DCT-Corr and PCA-DCT-Corr-PIFS. We performed
our experiments with the standard ORL face database.
Experimentally, we find that these combinations based
systems provide better results than the corresponding
individual algorithms, and combination of all four
individual algorithm perform better than multi-algorithmic
approaches in a combination of two and three individual
techniques based system. Overall, we find the system based
on combination of all of the four individual techniques
outperforms. The obvious reason for this is that the some
IDs are returned by first, second and third systems but not
by the fourth system in the group of four individual system.
When we combine these four techniques, these IDs got
combined and the recognition rate in both the cases i.e. for
the top5-IDs and for the top10-IDs increases. Average result
of four combinations, the PCA-DCT-Corr-PIFS based
system has the highest recognition rate in both the cases. In
future we can implement other algorithms and may combine
with these systems.
