ABSTRACT:-Face recognition technology has evolved
as a popular identification technique to perform
verification of human identity. By using the feature
extraction methods and dimensionality reduction
techniques in the pattern recognition applications, a
number of facial recognition systems has been produced
with distinct measure of success. Various face
recognition algorithms and their extensions, have been
proposed in the past three decades. However, face
recognition faces challenging problems in real life
applications because of the variation in the illumination
of the face images. In the recent years, the research is
focused towards Illumination-invariant face recognition
system and many approaches have been proposed. But,
there are several issues in face recognition across
illumination variation which still remains unsolved. This
paper provides a research on an efficient illumination-
invariant face recognition system using Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) and Principal Component Analysis
(PCA). For processing the illumination invariant image,
low frequency components of DCT are used to normalize
the illuminated image, odd and even components of DCT
is used for compensation in illumination variation and
PCA is used for recognition of face images. The existing
approaches in illumination Invariant face recognition are
comprehensively reviewed and discussed. The proposed
approach is validated with Yale Face Database B.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach in the performance of face recognition.

1.INTRODUCTION
Biometrics is an automated method of recognizing a
person based on their physical or behavioral
characteristics. Various types of recognition are available
commercially nowadays[1]. Face recognition is the
biometric identification of a human’s face and matching
the image against a library of known faces. It has become
the important area of research in computer vision and one
of the most successful applications of image analysis and
processing. Recently, the importance of face recognition
has been increasingly emphasized in the security since
978-1-4244-7926-9/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE
most of the popular areas are covered under CCD
cameras in various applications. However, the facial
images captured in uncontrolled and unconstrained
environments still faces a drop in the recognition
performance with the existing face recognition
techniques. The reason for the drop in the recognition
performance is because of the appearance variations of
the face image induced by various environmental factors,
among which illumination is one of the most important
factor. Changes in the illumination condition cause
dramatic variation in face appearance and seriously affect
the performance of face recognition systems. Hence, the
effect of illumination variation is one of the challenging
problems in a practical face recognition system. During
the last several years, research on face recognition has
been focused on reducing the impact of changes in
lighting conditions, facial expression and poses[2].
Illumination invariant face recognition algorithms need to
deal with the prominent amount of variation in
illumination between gallery and probe images.. Existing
approaches on the problem of illumination variation can
be divided into two main categories, active and passive
approaches. In the passive approaches, the illumination
variation problem is overcome by studying the visible
spectrum images which have been altered by illumination
variations. In the active approaches, the problem of
illumination variation is overcome by employing active
imaging techniques to obtain face images captured under
consistent illumination condition. Passive approaches can
further be divided into two groups. The first group
attempt to model the behavior of the face appearance as a
function of illumination. In the other group, the goal is to
remove the influence of illumination changes from face
images or to extract face features that are invariant to
illumination[3]. In this paper, a method for face
recognition on varying lighting conditions using low
frequency components of Discrete Cosine Transform and
Principal Component Analysis is proposed. The
organization of the paper is as follows: a review of
related literature is presented in Section 2. A concise
description about the methodology of proposed research
is presented in section 3. The experimental results and
analysis is presented in section 4 and finally the paper is
concluded in Section 5.
2. RELAVENT PREVIOUS WORKS
826Illumination-invariant face recognition is a very active
area of research and a number of illumination invariant
face recognition approaches have been proposed in the
recent years to cope up with illumination variations. All
the approaches towards illumination problem can be
broadly categorized as: transformation of images with
variable illumination to a canonical representation,
extracting illumination invariant features, modeling of
illumination variation and utilization of some 3-d face
models whose facial shapes and albedos are obtained in
advance [2].
The face images modeling in various illumination
condition is based on statistical or physical model.
Statistical analysis techniques, such as Principal
Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis,
are applied to the training set containing faces of different
illuminations to achieve a subspace that covers the
variation of possible illumination. In physical modelling,
the model of the image formation process is generated
based on the assumption of certain object surface
reflectance properties, like Lambertian reflectance[4].
Adini et al. [5] presented a study on Illumination
Invariant Features which evaluates the sensitivity of
illumination insensitive image representations to changes
in illumination. The representations include edge map,
image intensity derivatives, and the image convolved
with a 2D Gabor-like filter. These representations were
also followed by a log function to generate additional
representations. The experimentation proved that these
representations are not sufficient to overcome the image
variation arises due to the change of illumination
direction.
Histogram Equalisation [7] is the commonly used
approach for Photometric Normalization. In this, the
histogram of the pixel intensities in the resulting image is
flat. In Homomorphic filtering approach, the logarithm of
the equation of the reflectance model is taken to separate
the reflectance and luminance. Based on the assumption
that the illumination varies slowly across different
locations of the image and the local reflectance changes
quickly across different locations, a high-pass filtering
can be performed on the logarithm of the image to reduce
the luminance part, which is the low frequency
component of the image, and amplify the reflectance part,
which corresponds to the high frequency component.
Short et al. [9] compared five photometric normalization
and was proved that histogram equalisation helped in
every case. Chen et al. [10] employed DCT to
compensate for illumination variation in the logarithm
domain. The uneven illumination is removed in the image
reconstructed by inverse DCT after a number of DCT
coefficients corresponding to low frequency are
discarded.
Blanz and Vetter [8] proposed face recognition based on
fitting a 3D morphable model. The 3D morphable model
describes the shape and texture of face separately based
on the PCA analysis of the shape and texture obtained
from a database of 3D scans. In this, an optimization
process is needed to optimize shape coefficients, texture
coefficients along with parameters to minimize the
difference of the input image and the rendered image
based on the coefficients. The rendering parameters
include pose angles, 3D translation, ambient light
intensities, directed light intensities and angles, and other
parameters of the camera and color channels. After fitting
both the gallery images and the probe images to the
model, the recognition can be performed based on the
model coefficients for shape and texture. Good
recognition performance across pose and illumination is
achieved in experiments on CMUPIE and FERET face
database.
Few researches emerged on the features of the face image
that are invariant to variation in light. This has been
achieved by extracting only those features that are not
affected by variations in lighting conditions. Gradient
faces [11], 2D Gabor Filter [12], DCT coefficients [13],
LBP Feature [14] are some of the representations of
image. Different methods of passive approach using the
Discrete Cosine Transform under the illumination
condition are reviewed here.
Abbas et al., [15 ] proposed an illumination invariant face
recognition method in the logarithm discrete cosine
transform domain where an existing illumination
normalization technique in the logarithm DCT domain is
used. The principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm
is used for feature extraction in the DCT domain. By this,
the inverse DCT step is skipped and the computational
cost is reduced. Experimental results on the Yale B
database show that we obtain the same results exactly as
applying PCA in the spatial domain but with reduced
computational cost.
Heng Fui Liau et al. [16] have proposed a discrete cosine
transform (DCT) based technique for carrying out
illumination invariant face recognition. It has been
performed to tackle the consequences of illumination
variations on the performance of appearance based face
recognition methods. In this, instead of discarding
illumination variations, correcting the illumination
variation has been the objective of the method. In the
DCT domain, illumination variations that fall
predominantly in the low frequency band have been
normalized by their method. By controlling the properties
of the odd and even constituents of the DCT additional
effects of illumination variation which results in the
creation of shadows and specular defects have been
corrected. Their proposed method has many benefits.
First, it has not necessitated the utilization of training
images or an illumination model and can be employed
straightaway to the test image. Second, the system has
been simple. It has been easy to implement because only
one parameter is required to be determined. Their
proposed method has demonstrated comparable
performance in the experimental results on Yale face
827database B using PCA- and support vector machines
(SVM)-based face recognition algorithms.
Virendra P. et al. [17] proposed a Illumination Invariant
Accurate Face Recognition with Down Scaling of DCT
Coefficients. It utilizes the fact that discrete cosine
transform (DCT) low-frequency coefficients correspond
to illumination variations in a digital image. Under
varying illuminations, the images captured may have low
contrast; initially we apply histogram equalization on
these for contrast stretching. Then the low-frequency
DCT coefficients are scaled down to compensate the
illumination variations. The classification is done using
k−nearest neighbor classification and nearest mean
classification on the images obtained by inverse DCT on
the processed coefficients. The correlation coefficient and
Euclidean distance obtained using principal component
analysis are used as distance metrics in classification.
4. METHODOLOGY
The input image( I f ) is the virtual frontal face image.
Generally the illuminated face image I f ( x , y ) can be
considered as the product of reflectance R ( x , y ) and
luminance L ( x , y ) as shown in eqn (1).
I f ( x , y ) = R ( x , y ) L ( x , y )
(1)
Taking logarithm transform on eqn. (20), we get,
log I f ( x , y ) = log R ( x , y ) + log L ( x , y )
(2)
The linear equation obtained by taking logarithm
transform on equation (1) shows that adding the
logarithm transformed of reflectance and the logarithm
transform of luminance will yield the logarithm transform
of the illuminated image as shown in (2). Logarithmic
transform is frequently employed in the image processing
field, to expand the values of the dark pixels. While the
reflectance component lies mostly in the higher frequency
band, the luminance component lies mostly in the low
frequency band. So, the ‘low-pass version’ of the
illuminated images can be taken as the approximate
luminance component. The stable facial features are
represented by the reflectance component of an
illuminated face image under unstable lighting
conditions.
4.1 ILLUMINATION NORMALIZATION
By adding a compensation term, which compensates for
the non uniform illumination, the uniform luminance
component can be attained from the original image. The
following procedure is followed to compute the
compensation term. First, from the low frequency
components of DCT, an r × c image is rebuilt and its
mean is computed as follows,
1 c r
m =
log L ( x , y )
(3)
r × c x = 1 y = 1
Then the mean is subtracted from each pixel as follows,
∑∑
c ( x , y ) = 0 . 5 ∗ ( m − log L ( x , y ))
(4)
The low frequency components of DCT, is used and the
log L ( x , y ) is estimated. Single pixels that are dark are
indicated by negative value points and single pixels that
are bright are indicated by positive value points. The
difference between the pixel value and mean value are
halved by adjusting each pixel as shown in eqn. (4).
4.2 ILLUMINATION CORRECTION
The illumination variation in the face can easily be
compensated based on the properties of odd and even
components of DCT because of the symmetrical property
of the human face. Here, an illumination compensation
method based on manipulating even and odd DCT
components is used. Initially, from the odd and even DCT
components in the horizontal direction of the original
images, .two new images I odd and I even are
reconstructed. Then the pixels on the left half and the
right half are compared with each other. If the right-side
pixel is positive but corresponding left side pixel is
negative then both the pixel values will be adjusted.
While the important facial features are preserved the
illumination variations are largely reduced.
The
illumination corrected image obtained using the proposed
method, is shown in Fig. 1. Because the illumination
variation is corrected by the proposed method on basis of
the symmetry of the human face, the resultant output
image appears different from the original image. The left-
half side is made identical to the right-half side by
suitably aligning the output image. A face is not
accurately equal due to some slight variations in the two
halves of every face; for instance, the two eyes may have
small dissimilarity in sizes, only one side of the cheek
may have a mole, etc. Hence little adverse effects may be
present in the output images. Each image is normalized
for a mean of 0.5.
4.3 IMAGE RECOGITION
The normalized images are recognized by using the
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), after normalizing
the illuminated image by using the low frequency
components of DCT. Using a mathematical method,
numerous possibly correlated variables are transformed
into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables known as
principal components by PCA [19][20]. Compute the
eigen-faces from the training set by obtaining an initial
set of R normalized images (the training set) and
R ' Eigen faces that correspond to the highest Eigen value
are preserved.
5.EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
AND
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
The performance of illumination invariant face
recognition is commonly evaluated using the Yale face
database B. Nine different poses of 10 individuals are
present in the Yale face database B[21]. 64 different
illumination conditions exists for each pose. Single light
source images of 10 subjects each seen under 576
viewing conditions i.e., a total of 5850 images are present
828in the database. The proposed approach is implemented in
Matlab (7.10) and the results show that our approach has
an encouraging performance. Accuracy in face
recognition is computed with the false acceptance rate
(FAR) which is percentage of incorrect acceptances and
false rejection rate (FRR) which is the percentage of
incorrect rejections. The genuine acceptance rate is
computed using these factors and it determines the
overall accuracy measurement of the approach. The
experimental results shows that the approach of DCT
with PCA improves the accurate recognition rate in face
recognition. The sample output obtained from the
Illumination invariant process is shown in Fig.1.

6.CONCLUSION
In this paper, a methodology on illumination invariant
face recognition using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is discussed
through the process of normalization, compensation and
recognition of face images. Since variation of lighting
condition in input face image is the major problem in face
recognition, plenty of techniques were developed for
effective recognition under these circumstances. The
technique DCT with PCA in Yale Database B proves
good recognition rate. With these results, I conclude that
the combination of DCT with any other recognition
approaches could be experimented in order to improve
the illumination invariant recognition accuracy. However,
it is identified that the efficiency of the face recognition
system could be increased by the fusion of the existing
approaches in a system so that, the combinational results
will outperforms the existing methods in face recognition.
Therefore, in future work, the fusion of two illumination
invariant face recognition approaches could be
experimented for recognition efficiency in order to
determine the most effective approach in face recognition
across variations in illumination.
