Abstract-With
the collaborative filtering techniques becoming
more and more mature, recommender systems are widely used
nowadays,
especially
in
electronic
commerce
and
social
networks. However, the utilization of recommender system in
academic research itself has not received enough attention. A

would
greatly
help
researchers to find the most desirable papers in their fields of
endeavor.
Due
to
the textual nature
of
papers,
content
information could be integrated into existed recommendation
methods. In this paper, we proposed that by using topic model
techniques to make topic analysis on research papers, we could
introduce a thematic similarity measurement into a modified
version of item-based recommendation approach. This novel
recommendation method could considerable alleviate the cold

INTRODUCTION
Recommender system appeared in the early 1990s
[1] [2] [3] [4], and now they are playing a significant role in
people's daily lives. Online shopping site Amazon.com and
online movie rental company Netflix recommend
commodities and services by analyzing customers'
preferences and online behaviors. Social networking services
like [14] may suggest that you may know some people or
would possibly like someone to become your friend. There
are also interests-based social networking site like [15]
provides users with recommendations of books, music CDs,
movies, and articles, and recommendations of people who
might share the similar tastes based on users' ratings for the
mentioned items.
In colleges, universities and research institutions,
graduate students, professors, and other researchers need to
find the papers most relevant to their research projects. Thus,
looking for the right papers to read becomes a very important
part of their academic lives. A research paper recommender
system will benefit these people in helping the most relevant
papers and saving their precious time. Unluckily, paper
research recommender systems have not received enough
attention. The currently rare available work includes [16],
[17], [18], [19] etc. All these work have not taken thematic
information of research papers into recommendation. And
978-1-4244-7164-5/$26.00 © 2010 IEEE
there is even no appropriate dataset available for the overall
evaluation of research paper recommendation algorithms.
A recommender system primarily exploits two kinds of
information: users' ratings for items, profiles of users and/or
items. Memory-based recommendation makes use of only
the users' ratings for items, say, the user-item matrix, with
each entry the rating of a user for a certain item. There are
basically two kinds of memory-based recommendations:
user-based recommendation and item-based recommendation
[6] [7]. User-based recommendation attaches higher weights
for users who share the similar rating patterns with the active
user and calculate the utilities of new items from these
weighted users. Item-based recommendation evaluate an
item's utility for a user by first selecting its most similar
items that have been rated by the user, then compute the
utility as the weighted average of the rating of these similar
items. For an online recommender system, when the number
of the users grows to a considerable amount, the computation
of similarity of every user pair's rating patterns would be
very time consuming, thus item-based recommendation
could provide a feasible approach for it computes the
similarities between items offline. Reference [8] gives a nice
comprehensive survey on recommender systems.
Research paper recommendation would not only utilize
the user-item matrix but also the content information of the
research papers. We use topic model techniques to make
topic analysis of research papers and introduced the
similarity over topics between research papers as the
thematic similarity. By incorporating the thematic similarity
and a modified version of item-based method, we could
successfully generate highly relevant recommendations and
greatly relieve the cold start problem.
II.
COLLABORATIVE FILTERING
References [5][6] [7][8][9] describe the details of the two
approaches of memory-based recommendations: user-based
recommendation and item-based recommendation, very well.
For later convenience we will still elaborate on these two
approaches.
In a typical recommender system, we have a user set U
consists of N users, an item set I consists of M items and a
rating set R in which rlli stands for user u's rating for item i.
SII � I stands for the set of items user u has rated.
Collaborative filtering algorithms attempt to compute the
expected ratings or say, utilities of items that has not been
rated by the active user, then present the active user with the
V4-264

Pearson correlation:
items with the highest utilities. We will describe below the
details of relevant memory-based recommendations: user­
based recommendation, item-based recommendation and our
modified version of item-based recommendation.

User-based Recommendation
In a collaborative filtering algorithm we are to compute
the utility Pai of the active user a on a given item i that has
not been rated by this user. Since the item i is not rated by
user a, thus we have irl. S a . For user-based recommendation,
the utility of an unrated item for a user is based on the ratings
of that item of the nearest neighbors of the user. A similarity
measure between users need to be defined and a set of
nearest neighbors to be selected. Then we combine the
ratings of these neighbors on the item in some way.
The way we can define the similarity between users will
be described in A.I). Let sim( a, u) be similarity between
users a and u. The number of neighbors to be considered is
often set by a system parameter that we denote by K, K is
often set to N, the total number of users in the system. So the
set of neighbors of a give user a, denoted by Ta, is made of
the K users that maximize their similarity to user a.
We define the utility of item i for user a as the weighted
sum of the ratings of the nearest neighbors uE Ta that have
already rated item i:
Simple cosine:
(5)
There are also other similarity definitions as Manhattan
similarity, Jaccard similarity, Tanimoto score, but we will
not describe them here.
B.
In the item-based approach, Pai, the utility of an unrated
item i for the user a is computed as follows:
We choose the most similar rated K items by user a for
item i. We denote the set of these K items as h. rk stands for
rating of item h E h. So the utility of the unrated item i is:
Pai =
(1)
In order to take into account the difference in user of
rating scale by different users, predictions based on
deviations from the mean ratings have been proposed. In that
case, Pai is computed using the sum of the user mean rating
and the weighted sum of deviations from their mean rating of
the neighbors that have rated item i:
- L{uqYEsJsim(a,u). (rUi - rJ

This formula simply weights the ratings of items
according to their respective similarity with the current item
being evaluated, and computes an average.
III.
1) Similarity Measurements
The similarity defined between users or items include but
are not limited to the following ways:
(6)
Like the user-based approach, we also have a method to
compute utility of i using deviation from the mean rating
given by user a.
If we use the recommendation provided by formula (6),
we could easily find out that when the user has just rated one
item or has given a few items the same rating, utilities of all
the unrated items will be the same as the given rating. In that
case no unrated item could be given preference in
recommendation.
Since we hope our recommendation could give reliable
recommendations even when the user has just rated very few
items or even one item. We will use a modified version of
item-based recommendation:

TOPIC ANALYSIS
Topic models [10] [11] are based upon the idea that with
in text corpora, a document is a mixture of topics, where a
topic is a multinomial distribution over words. The latent
dirichlet allocation (LDA) model (or "topic model") is a
generative model for documents: it specifies a simple
probabilistic procedure by which documents can be
generated. The mixing coefficients for each document and
V4-265
Volume 42010 International Conference On Computer Design And Appliations (ICCDA 2010)
the word-topic distributions are unobserved and are learned
from data using unsupervised learning methods.
LDA can be described as finding a mixture of topics for
each document, i.e., P(z I d), with each topic described by
words following another probability distribution, i.e., pet I z).
This can be formalized as
z
P(1i I d) =
L P(ti I Zi = j)P(Zi = j I d)

CTZ maintains a count of all topic-word assignments, (!Yz
counts the document-topic assignments, Z_i represents all
topic-word and document-topic assignments except the
current assignment Zi for word ti, a and fJ are the
hyperparameters for the Dirichlet priors, serving as
smoothing parameters for the counts. Based on the counts
the posterior probabilities in Equation (8) can be estimated as
follows:
(10)
P(Zi = ]
jE[I, D], WE[I, W), kE[I, K].
We define the thematic similarity between two research
papers p and
as the cosine similarity defined over their
q
topic mixture coefficient vector
and 8 [ q :
8[p)
j='l
where P(ti I d) is the probability of the ith word for a given
document d and Zi is the latent topic. P(ti I Z i = j) is the
probability of ti within topic j. P(Zi = j I d) is the probability of
generating a word from topic j in the document d. The
number of latent topics Z is defined in advance and controls
the granularity of differences among latent topics. LDA
estimates the topic-word distribution pet I z) and the
document-topic distribution P(z I d) from an unlabeled
corpus of documents using Dirichlet priors for the
distributions and a fixed number of topics.
Reference Blei et al [11] introduced the LDA model
within a general Bayesian framework and developed a
variational algorithm for learning the model from data.
Reference Griffiths and Steyvers [12] subsequently proposed
a learning algorithm based on Gibbs sampling. The Gibbs
sampling approach iterates multiple times over each word ti
in document di, and samples a new topic j for the word based
on Equation (8), until the LDA model parameters converge.

Simply put, we are going to use Gibbs sampling methods
to compute the mixture coefficients of each topic in a
document, and the coefficients of a topic's multinomial
distribution over words.
Say we have D documents in the corpora, W unique
words appeared within, N words in total, and we suppose
there are K topics in the corpora. Using Gibbs sampling for
LDA we could obtain the results as follows:

As we know, there are a variety of ways to define the
similarity between vectors, but in our experiment we simply
choose simple cosine similarity for the computation of
recommendations.
In our recommendation method we use thematic
similarity to replace the original similarity get from user-item
matrix, combined with modified item-based method, we
could make research paper recommendations for users. This
recommendation method could considerably alleviate cold
start problem of recommender systems. In a typical
recomender system, cold start problem has two situations.
One is that when a user has just ranked very few items, it is
very difficult to generate recommendations accurately due to
the little information of the user we have. The other situation
is that when a new item has just been registered in the system,
no user has yet got time to rate the item, so that this item will
not get the slightest chance to be recommended. For most
recommender system the first situation is more severe and
more common than the second situation. Our method could
relieve both the two situations greatly, especially the first
situation.

EXPERIMENT
Our experiment is carried in the following procedure and
we will demonstrate the result all along, and we will make
data and result available online for the convenience of other
researchers.
We take 122 research papers from the research paper
collection of our laboratory, mainly on biometrics research,
as the research papers that are going to be used in our
recomender system. They are all in Portable Document
Format (PDF).
Then all these PDF files are converted into text files
using a Java library called Apache PDF Box [22]. These text
can be download at [20].
We preprocessed these text files and use a perl script by
David Newman to make these research papers into uel Bag­
Of-Words Dataset format [21]. The dataset generated by us
is available here [20].
We implemented the Gibbs sampling algorithm to
process the dataset we generated. We took 40 topics, and
a =2.0/40, fJ =0.01 as the parameters in our inference. We
successfully computed the coefficient of topic mixture in
each research paper and the multinomial coefficient for each

59: "A Novel Scheme for Fingerprint Identification" by
Tsong-Liang Huang et aI. Only 12 topics with highest
mixture weight are show in Table I. It is very obvious that
this research paper is mainly about Topic 32 and Topic 27.
Topics 32 and 27's probability to generate each word is
shown in Table 3 and 4. Only 20 words with the highest
probability are shown.
Then we computed the thematic similarities between all
possible pairs of research papers. Results are available here
[20). We can easily find that the thematic similarity between
Doc. 59 and Doc.61 is 0.99821355. The topic weights of
Doc. 61 are shown in Table. 2. Doc. 61 is "A Pixel-Level
Automatic Calibration Circuit Scheme for Capacitive
Fingerprint Sensor LSIs" by Hiroki Morimura et aI. We can
easily find out that these two papers are quite similar in their
main topics.
In the recommendation scenario we consider a user that
has only rated 3 papers: Doc. 14, 31, 59, with respective
rating 1, -2, 2. We take rating -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 to stand for
"awful", "bad", "so-so", "good", "awesome".
We successfully use our recommendation algorithm to
generate the recommendations with the highest predicted
utility for this user. The recommendation result is available
here [20] and partly shown in Table 5 on next page.

CONCLUSION
Recommender systems are a powerful technology for
electronic commerce and social networks. They can help a
business to increase sales revenue and help customers to find
product to their liking, or help people to find friends who
share the same taste for things. At the same time their
potential impact on scientific research is largely unexplored.
We proposed a novel method for research paper
recommendation. We proved by our experiment that by
making topic analysis on research papers and introducing
thematic similarity we could recommend highly relevant
papers and considerably alleviate the cold start problem.
Even when the user has just rated very few papers, we could
still generate satisfactory recommendations.
